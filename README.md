# projects-data-science
This repository is dedicated to organizing and storing projects and knowledge acquired throughout my journey in Data Science. Each folder represents a topic, technique, or practical project, including notes, notebooks, scripts, and insights. It's designed for personal reference and to share knowledge with the community.
